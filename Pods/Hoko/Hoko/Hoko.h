 *  Hoko is an easy-to-use Framework to handle Deeplinking.

 *  This is a simple drop-in class for handling incoming deeplinks.
 *  With the Hoko framework you can map routes to your view controllers, add handlers that trigger when
 *  deeplinks are the point of entry to your application.
 *
 *  - HOKDeeplinking - handles every incoming deeplink, so long as it has been mapped
 *
 *  You should setup Hoko on your AppDelegate's application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:, by calling
 *  [Hoko setupWithToken:@"YOUR-API-TOKEN"].
